string_truncate
===============

This Java program will take either a single word or phrase or a .csv file of words 
and phrases and truncate them semi-intelligently; useful for modifying long words 
to fit into length restrictions (inputing a .csv file will require the included 
library, opencsv).

This program will provide prompts to direct you and if you wish to truncate a file
containing many words or phrases, please ensure that the file is in the same folder
as the program.

This program is a .jar file, but unfortuantely has no UI so to run it please 
use the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the location of the .jar file 
(using cd) and then run it using the command "java -jar StringTruncate.jar". On 
windows please ensure that the Java path is set correctly before running the
program.
